        "Every individual today spends most of their time in social media for updating status, checking the status of other people and following the public figures, brands organizations etc. Some of the top strong platforms of the social media are Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Not only the common people but also the organizations, public figures including the politicians, film actors& actress, elections and even the government organizations have chosen these platforms to promote their day to day activities.  Even many organizations assume that the direct public opinion can be heard through these platforms correctly without any manipulation of the information in the middle. Do you really understand how powerful these platforms are now? So, many organizations analyse the data which is collected from these sites for the betterment of the tools for their organizations. One of the questions which arise in the mind is. Is this ethical? Are we acknowledging the people regarding this before collecting the data or at least while their status updation!!\n",

        "The most common mobile phone that everyone uses these days is Apple. Personally, I use the iPhone. I had various doubts while purchasing it because some of my friends said iPhone XS is good and some say iPhone X works very well when compared to XS and some say XR. As all the three models are released at a time, I faced lots of confusion while purchasing. I hope many of us have the same problem while purchasing. So, in order to know the voice of the public opinion and as part of the assignment, I consider Apple - iPhone brand and apply the sentiment analysis for the public opinion and finally analyse the risks.\n",

Many algorithms are implemented on the tweets for the analyzation of the best suitable algorithm that would reduce the error rate to predict the output accurately.  Generally, we don't expect the algorithms to do mistakes. But sometime in the real world, they do mistakes too. So, we will calculate the confidence of each algorithm. This is done by F-score. The training dataset is classified into 10 folds, in which most of them around 8 or 9 are for the training dataset and the 1 is for the testing dataset. This complete methodology is known as holdout cross validation. \n",

        "The purpose of the assignment is to perform sentiment analysis on the tweets collected by twitter. Sentiment analysis can be defined as the technique which helps to develop the organization or the brand by collecting the social sentiments of the people from the social media platforms. Thus, the problem statement for our work could be the sentiment analysis on the iPhone X, XS from the twitter based on the tweets with hashtags #iPhone X #iPhone XS #apple etc. We classified the tweets into negative, positive and neutral based on the online dictionary. We implemented four different classifiers i.e. Naive Bayes, KNN, Random Forest and Neural network out of which KNN gave the best results in terms of more accuracy. The ROC curve also suggests this. Most of the tweets from the users are positive which also indicates that they are happy with the product and the iPhone X is a successful phone. These kinds of analyses will improve the capital and also the brand name in the business market. This sentiment analyses is not limited to phones, we can perform on any real world things. \n",

        "Many organizations analyse the data which is collected from these sites for the betterment of the tools for their organizations. One of the questions which arise in the mind is. Is this ethical? Are we acknowledging the people regarding this before collecting the data or at least while their status updation!! \n",
        "\n",
        "Personally speaking, if the social media platform specifies that their tweets are collected for analyses purpose, then I think some sort ethical behaviour. But if they miss to mention, then its unethical.\n",
